## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We have written a number of tools and software to suit our needs when doing bioinformatics related work.
We use Rust as our main programming language because of its convenient Cargo and active community. We can easily write safe and fast software.

Against this background, Bio-Here was born, which is a collection of Bio-Here software that is still being refined.
